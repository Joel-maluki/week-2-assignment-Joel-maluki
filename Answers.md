1. What is functional testing, and why is it important in software development?

Functional testing is a type of software testing that verifies whether-
 the application behaves as expected by checking its functionality against defined requirements.
 It involves testing user interfaces, APIs, databases, security, and other functional components.

Importance in Software Development:
Ensures the software meets business requirements.
Identifies bugs early, reducing future costs.
Enhances user satisfaction by delivering a reliable product.
Helps in verifying compliance with specifications.
Example:
Testing a login feature to verify that entering correct credentials 
grants access while incorrect credentials show an error message.


2. Differentiate between unit testing and integration testing. Provide one example for each.
Aspect	Unit Testing	Integration Testing
Definition	Tests individual components of a software separately.	Tests how different modules interact with each other.
Focus	Focuses on a single function or module.	Focuses on data flow between modules.
Conducted By	Developers during the coding phase.	Testers after unit testing is completed.
Example	Testing a function that calculates the total price of a shopping cart.	
Checking if the shopping cart module correctly updates the order processing system.


3. Explain the purpose of system testing and acceptance testing. How do they contribute to software quality?
a) System Testing:
Tests the entire system as a whole.
Ensures all integrated components work together as expected.
Verifies functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., security, performance).
Example: Running a full test on an e-commerce platform to check if users can browse products, add them to the cart, and complete a purchase successfully.

b) Acceptance Testing:
Conducted to verify if the software meets business needs and user expectations.
Usually performed by end-users or clients before deployment.
Ensures the product is ready for release.
Example: A company deploying payroll software will conduct acceptance testing by verifying if employees' salaries are calculated and paid correctly.

Contribution to Software Quality:
Reduces system failures by ensuring full functionality.
Enhances user experience by confirming business needs are met.
Improves reliability and performance before deployment.

4. What is non-functional testing, and how does it differ from functional testing?
Non-functional Testing:
Non-functional testing evaluates the performance, usability, security, and reliability 
of a software system rather than its functional correctness. It ensures the software meets user expectations beyond basic features.

Difference from Functional Testing:
Aspect	Functional Testing	Non-Functional Testing
Purpose	Verifies what the system does.	Evaluates how well the system performs.
Focus	Checks features and functions.	Tests performance, security, usability, etc.
Example	Checking if a user can log in successfully.	Measuring how fast the login page loads under heavy traffic.

5. Give two examples of non-functional testing and explain why they are important.
1. Performance Testing
Measures system responsiveness, speed, and scalability under different loads.
Helps identify bottlenecks before deployment.
Ensures a smooth user experience even with high traffic.
Example: Testing how an online store handles 1,000 simultaneous users during a flash sale.

2. Security Testing
Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures data protection.
Prevents unauthorized access and cyber threats.
Ensures compliance with security standards.
Example: Testing if a banking app properly encrypts user passwords and prevents unauthorized logins.
